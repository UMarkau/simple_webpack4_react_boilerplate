## Contains COMMON components that are used or can be used in other components.

### Each component is placed in a separate folder that contains the component itself and the styles for it, if necessary:

```
components/
..SomeComponent/
....SomeComponent.js
....SomeComponent.module.scss
```

> Components are exported via index.js in the components folder. For components use ONLY named export.
